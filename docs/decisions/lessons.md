## Our Learning Philosophy

**We believe in**:
- **Fast feedback loops** - Learn quickly, adjust quickly
- **Shared knowledge** - What one person learns, the whole team benefits from
- **Honest retrospectives** - Celebrate wins, own mistakes, extract lessons
- **Applied learning** - Turn insights into better processes and decisions

## Key Lessons by Category

### Product Development

#### Lesson #001: Start Narrow, Go Deep
**What Happened**: Initially planned to build events + movies + restaurants + news simultaneously.
**What We Learned**: Users were confused about our core value. It's better to dominate one area first.
**How We Changed**: Events-first approach with phased expansion.
**Impact**: Clearer positioning, faster development, better user experience.

#### Lesson #002: Manual First, Automate Second
**What Happened**: Planned to build automated event scraping from day one.
**What We Learned**: Manual curation teaches you what good content looks like.
**How We Changed**: Hand-pick first 100+ events, then build automation based on learned patterns.
**Impact**: Higher quality content, better understanding of user preferences.

### User Research

#### Lesson #003: Talk to Users Early and Often
**What Happened**: Made assumptions about what Indian diaspora users wanted.
**What We Learned**: Real user needs were different from our assumptions.
**How We Changed**: Weekly user interviews, feedback collection built into product.
**Impact**: Product-market fit insights, feature prioritization clarity.

#### Lesson #004: Geography Matters More Than We Thought
**What Happened**: Assumed users would engage with events anywhere in their region.
**What We Learned**: Users primarily care about events within 30-45 minutes of their location.
**How We Changed**: Hyper-local focus within SF Bay Area first.
**Impact**: Higher engagement, better venue partnerships.

### Team & Process

#### Lesson #005: Document Decisions in Real-Time
**What Happened**: Had to re-discuss the same decisions multiple times.
**What We Learned**: Writing down "why" prevents re-litigation and helps new team members.
**How We Changed**: This decision log process, immediate documentation.
**Impact**: Faster onboarding, consistent decision-making.

#### Lesson #006: Weekly Goals Beat Monthly Targets
**What Happened**: Monthly planning led to end-of-month scrambling.
**What We Learned**: Weekly cycles create better momentum and course correction opportunities.
**How We Changed**: Weekly sprint planning with daily standups.
**Impact**: More consistent progress, earlier problem detection.

## Market & Business Insights

### Competition

#### What We've Discovered About Our Space
- **Incumbents are complacent**: Ticketmaster, Eventbrite treat our niche as afterthought
- **Niche players lack execution**: Good intent but poor user experience
- **Content is king**: Better curation beats better technology
- **Trust is everything**: Users need to believe we'll have accurate, current information

### User Behavior

#### Patterns We're Seeing
- **Discovery happens on mobile**: 85%+ of event browsing is on phones
- **Decision-making is social**: Users share events before committing
- **Timing matters**: Peak engagement is Thursday-Sunday for weekend planning
- **Price sensitivity varies**: Free events get high engagement, premium events need clear value

### Partnerships

#### What Works in Venue Relationships
- **Lead with value**: Show them engaged users before asking for integration
- **Start small**: Begin with listing partnership before booking integration
- **Local relationships matter**: Personal connections trump cold outreach
- **Mutual success metrics**: Align on what success looks like for both sides

## Technical Learnings

### Architecture

#### Lesson #007: Simple Infrastructure First
**What Happened**: Considered microservices architecture from start.
**What We Learned**: Complexity without scale is just complexity.
**How We Changed**: Monolithic architecture with clear module boundaries.
**Impact**: Faster development, easier debugging, lower operational overhead.

#### Lesson #008: Real Users Break Everything
**What Happened**: Alpha testing revealed edge cases we never considered.
**What We Learned**: No amount of internal testing replaces real user behavior.
**How We Changed**: Earlier alpha release, better error handling and monitoring.
**Impact**: More robust product, faster bug detection.

### Data & Analytics

#### What We Track vs What Actually Matters
- **Vanity metrics**: Total signups, page views
- **Reality metrics**: Weekly active users, event page to signup conversion
- **Leading indicators**: Content engagement, user return visits
- **Lagging indicators**: Revenue, partnerships, retention

## Mistakes & Course Corrections

### What Didn't Work

#### Mistake #001: Trying to Launch in 3 Cities Simultaneously
**The Problem**: Divided attention, inconsistent content quality, harder to measure success.
**The Fix**: SF Bay Area focus first, then expand city by city.
**The Lesson**: Geographic focus creates network effects and operational efficiency.

#### Mistake #002: Building Features Before Validating Need
**The Problem**: Built event rating system before users were even discovering events consistently.
**The Fix**: Focus on core user journey first, add bells and whistles later.
**The Lesson**: Solve the main problem completely before adding secondary features.

#### Mistake #003: Underestimating Content Curation Effort
**The Problem**: Thought we could automate event data collection immediately.
**The Fix**: Manual curation process with gradual automation.
**The Lesson**: Understanding your content deeply is prerequisite to automating it.
