# Our Pivots & Course Corrections

Every startup changes direction - it's not failure, it's learning! This page captures the times we shifted our approach, what we learned, and how it made Beet better.

## What Is a Pivot?

A pivot is when we deliberately change our strategy based on what we've learned. It's not giving up - it's being smart about adapting to reality.

**Types of pivots we might make:**
- **Product Pivot**: Changing what we build
- **Market Pivot**: Changing who we serve
- **Strategy Pivot**: Changing how we grow
- **Technology Pivot**: Changing how we build

## Our Story So Far

### Course Correction #001: Focus on Events First

**When**: June 2025
**Status**: âœ… Active Shift
**Impact**: High

**What We Were Doing Before**:
Building a general entertainment platform trying to do everything at once - events, movies, restaurants, news.

**What We Learned**:
- Users were confused about what Beet actually does
- It's impossible to be great at everything from day one
- Event discovery was the strongest user need we could solve
- Competitors were weak specifically in Indian diaspora events

**What We Changed To**:
Events-first approach with clear expansion plan:
1. **Month 1-3**: Cricket & Bollywood events only
2. **Month 4-6**: Add movie booking integration
3. **Month 7-9**: Add restaurant partnerships
4. **Month 10+**: Full super-app experience

**Why This Made Sense**:
- Events have the highest emotional engagement
- Clear competitive advantage in our niche
- Easier to explain to users and investors
- Still sets foundation for super-app vision

**Results So Far**:
ðŸŽ¯ **Too early to measure** - just made this decision!

**Key Lesson**: Better to own one thing completely than to be mediocre at many things.

### Course Correction #002: SF Bay Area First

**When**: June 2025
**Status**: âœ… Active Shift
**Impact**: Medium

**What We Were Doing Before**:
Planning to launch in multiple cities simultaneously (SF, LA, NYC).

**What We Learned**:
- Content curation requires local knowledge and relationships
- Marketing is more effective when concentrated
- Support and feedback collection easier with focused geography
- Network effects stronger when users are in same area

**What We Changed To**:
Deep focus on SF Bay Area for first 6 months:
- Manual curation of every single event
- Local venue partnerships
- Community building in one geography
- Perfect the experience before expanding

**Why This Made Sense**:
- SF Bay Area has high concentration of target users
- Tech-savvy early adopters
- Strong Indian diaspora community
- Easier to get press coverage and word-of-mouth

**Results So Far**:
ðŸŽ¯ **Too early to measure** - just made this decision!

**Key Lesson**: Geographic focus creates stronger local network effects than spreading thin.

## Future Pivot Monitoring

### What We're Watching For

**User Signals That Might Trigger Pivots**:
- Low engagement with event listings
- High demand for features we don't have
- Users using the product differently than expected
- Strong preference for specific event types

**Market Signals**:
- Major competitor launches in our space
- Changes in how people discover events
- Economic changes affecting entertainment spending
- Platform changes (iOS, Google, social media)

**Business Signals**:
- Revenue not meeting projections
- Partnership challenges
- Team capacity constraints
- Funding or runway concerns

### Our Pivot Process

When we spot signals that might require a course correction:

1. **Gather Data** (1 week): User research, analytics, team input
2. **Analyze Options** (1 week): What could we change and what would it cost?
3. **Test Small** (2 weeks): Pilot the new approach with subset of users
4. **Decide Fast** (1 week): Go/no-go based on results
5. **Communicate Clear** (ongoing): Tell team, users, partners what's changing

**Golden Rule**: Pivot quickly when data shows we should, but don't pivot just because something is hard.
