## Major Product Decisions

### Decision #001: Authentication Strategy

**Date**: January 15, 2024
**Status**: Accepted
**Owner**: Product Team

**Context**: We need to decide how users will create accounts and log into Beet. There are multiple approaches with different complexity and user experience trade-offs.

**Decision**: Implement email/password authentication only for MVP, with social login (Google, Facebook) planned for Phase 2.

**Alternatives Considered**:

1. Social login only (Google, Facebook, Apple)
2. Email/password + social login in MVP
3. Passwordless authentication (magic links)
4. Enterprise SSO integration first

**Reasoning**:

- Email/password is universally understood by users
- Simplest to implement and maintain for small team
- Covers 95% of user authentication needs
- Allows us to control the entire user experience
- Social login can be added later without breaking existing users

**Consequences**:

- **Positive**: Faster development, complete control, works for all users
- **Negative**: Slightly higher friction than social login, password management burden on users
- **Risk**: Some users may prefer social login and bounce

**Implementation**: User Authentication feature team

### Decision #002: Technology Stack

**Date**: January 10, 2024
**Status**: Accepted
**Owner**: Technical Team

**Context**: Need to choose primary technology stack for backend, frontend, and database to begin development.

**Decision**:

- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Hosting**: AWS/Heroku for MVP

**Alternatives Considered**:

1. Node.js + Express backend
2. Django instead of FastAPI
3. MySQL or MongoDB for database
4. Vue.js or Angular for frontend

**Reasoning**:

- Team has strong Python expertise
- FastAPI provides fast development and good documentation
- PostgreSQL handles complex data relationships well
- React has large ecosystem and team familiarity
- TypeScript prevents many runtime errors

**Consequences**:

- **Positive**: Fast development, good performance, strong typing
- **Negative**: May need scaling considerations later, learning curve for some team members
- **Risk**: Python/FastAPI less common than Node.js in startup ecosystem

**Implementation**: All development teams

### Decision #003: MVP Feature Scope

**Date**: January 20, 2024
**Status**: Accepted
**Owner**: Product Team

**Context**: Need to define minimum viable product scope to focus development efforts and get to market quickly.

**Decision**: MVP includes only User Authentication, Basic Dashboard, and Core Data Processing features.

**Features Included**:

- User registration and login
- Email verification
- Personal dashboard with basic analytics
- Core data processing workflow
- Basic user profile management

**Features Excluded** (for later phases):

- Team collaboration features
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Mobile application
- API for third-party integrations
- Advanced user roles and permissions

**Reasoning**:

- Focuses on core user value proposition
- Can be built and tested within 3-month timeline
- Provides foundation for future features
- Allows us to validate market fit quickly
- Small team can maintain quality with limited scope

**Consequences**:

- **Positive**: Clear focus, achievable timeline, early user feedback
- **Negative**: May not satisfy all user needs, competitive disadvantage vs full-featured products
- **Risk**: Users may not see enough value in limited feature set

**Implementation**: All teams, affects roadmap and resource allocation

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Decision #004: Database Schema Design

**Date**: January 25, 2024
**Status**: Accepted
**Owner**: Backend Team

**Context**: Need to design database schema that supports current features and can scale to future requirements.

**Decision**: Use normalized relational database design with clear entity relationships and foreign key constraints.

**Key Design Choices**:

- Separate users, sessions, and profile tables
- UUID primary keys for better security and distribution
- Timestamps on all records for audit trail
- Soft deletes for user data retention
- Indexed fields for common queries

**Alternatives Considered**:

1. Document-based schema (MongoDB style)
2. Single table design with JSON fields
3. Microservices with separate databases per service

**Reasoning**:

- Relational data fits our use case well
- PostgreSQL ACID properties ensure data consistency
- Clear relationships make data easier to understand
- Good performance for expected data volumes
- Team familiar with SQL and relational concepts

**Consequences**:

- **Positive**: Data integrity, clear relationships, good performance
- **Negative**: More complex migrations, harder to scale horizontally
- **Risk**: May need schema changes as product evolves

**Implementation**: Backend development team

### Decision #005: API Design Approach

**Date**: February 1, 2024
**Status**: Accepted
**Owner**: Backend Team

**Context**: Need to design API structure that frontend can use efficiently and that can evolve over time.

**Decision**: RESTful API design with clear resource endpoints and standard HTTP methods.

**Design Principles**:

- Resource-based URLs (/users, /sessions, /data)
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Consistent response formats with status codes
- Clear error messages and handling
- API versioning from the start (/api/v1/)

**Alternatives Considered**:

1. GraphQL for more flexible queries
2. RPC-style endpoints for each action
3. Single endpoint with action parameters

**Reasoning**:

- REST is well-understood by all team members
- Clear conventions make API predictable
- Easy to document and test
- Frontend team familiar with REST consumption
- Good tooling and library support

**Consequences**:

- **Positive**: Clear, predictable, well-documented API
- **Negative**: May require multiple requests for complex data
- **Risk**: Over-fetching or under-fetching data in some cases

**Implementation**: Backend and frontend teams

## User Experience Decisions

### Decision #006: Registration Flow Design

**Date**: February 5, 2024
**Status**: Accepted
**Owner**: Design Team

**Context**: Users need to create accounts, but registration friction can reduce conversion rates.

**Decision**: Simple 2-step registration: basic info first, then email verification.

**Registration Flow**:

1. Landing page with clear value proposition
2. Registration form with email, password, confirm password
3. Immediate confirmation page explaining email verification
4. Email with verification link
5. Email verification leads directly to dashboard

**Alternatives Considered**:

1. Single-page registration with immediate access
2. Multi-step registration collecting more user information
3. Registration with phone number verification
4. Progressive registration (basic first, details later)

**Reasoning**:

- Balances security needs with user experience
- Email verification prevents spam accounts
- Clear expectations reduce user confusion
- Minimal information requested reduces abandonment
- Immediate value after verification encourages engagement

**Consequences**:

- **Positive**: Good balance of security and UX, clear user expectations
- **Negative**: Additional step may reduce conversion, email delivery dependency
- **Risk**: Users may not check email or verification emails may be blocked

**Implementation**: Design and frontend teams

## Business Strategy Decisions

### Decision #007: Pricing Strategy for MVP

**Date**: February 10, 2024
**Status**: Proposed
**Owner**: Business Team

**Context**: Need to decide pricing approach for MVP launch to validate market demand and generate initial revenue.

**Decision**: Freemium model with generous free tier and single paid upgrade option.

**Pricing Structure**:

- **Free tier**: Basic features for individual users, limited usage
- **Pro tier**: $[X]/month for advanced features and higher usage limits
- **No enterprise tier initially**: Focus on individual and small team users

**Alternatives Considered**:

1. Completely free during beta period
2. Simple paid subscription with no free tier
3. Usage-based pricing per transaction/processing
4. Multiple pricing tiers from launch

**Reasoning**:

- Free tier allows users to experience value before paying
- Single paid tier simplifies decision-making for users
- Easier to communicate and support than complex pricing
- Can optimize pricing based on actual usage data
- Common pattern in similar products

**Consequences**:

- **Positive**: Lower barrier to adoption, data to optimize pricing later
- **Negative**: Many users may never convert to paid, free users have support costs
- **Risk**: Free tier may cannibalize paid subscriptions if too generous

**Implementation**: Product and business teams
