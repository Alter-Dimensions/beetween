**Decision ID**: ADR-001  
**Date**: 2025-06-01  
**Status**: âœ… Accepted  
**Impact**: ðŸ”´ High  
**Owner**: Product Team  
**Category**: Product

## Context

We needed to figure out the best way for people to create accounts and access Beet. There are lots of options, each with different complexity and user experience trade-offs.

## Decision

Start simple with email/password for launch, then add social login (Google, Facebook) in Phase 2.

## Alternatives Considered

1. Social login only (Google, Facebook, Apple)
2. Email/password + social login from day one
3. Passwordless authentication (magic links)
4. Enterprise SSO integration first

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes
- Faster to build and launch
- Works for everyone (universal compatibility)
- We control the entire user experience

### Trade-offs & Risks
- Takes an extra step vs social login
- Users have to remember passwords

### Success Metrics
- User registration completion rate > 80%
- Login success rate > 95%
