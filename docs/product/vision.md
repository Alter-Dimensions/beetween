# **Beet Vision**

*This document is the single source of truth for our mission, strategy, and definition of success. It is a living document, and the placeholders `[TBD]` mark our highest-priority areas for research and validation. We will review this before every major strategic decision.*

## **Part 1: The Thesis (The "Why")**

### 1. The Inevitable Future

Our vision is a world where every member of the Indian diaspora can instantly access the pulse of their culture, creating a continent-wide, digitally-connected community.

### 2. The Physics of the Problem (First Principles)

Our core belief is that the market is governed by three fundamental laws:

* **The Law of Fragmentation:**
  Entertainment information for this demographic is scattered across `[TBD: survey to quantify N > 10]` platforms, an inherently inefficient state.

* **The Law of Wasted Time:**
  This fragmentation imposes a time tax of `[TBD: survey to quantify avg. 15-20 mins]` per search, leading to user abandonment.

* **The Law of Missed Connections:**
  `[TBD: survey to quantify, e.g., 75%]` of users miss events they want to attend, resulting in lost opportunities for cultural and social connection.

### 3. The Market Inefficiency (The "Why Now")

This problem persists due to a perfect storm of opportunity:

* **Incumbent Complacency:**
  Large, horizontal players (Eventbrite, Ticketmaster) lack the focus to serve this vertical niche effectively.

* **The Competitive Vacuum:**
  Existing niche players `[TBD: list 2-3]` lack the technical execution or capital to solve the problem at scale.

* **The Catalyst Event:**
  The DOJ's antitrust lawsuit against Ticketmaster has destabilized the market leader, creating a once-in-a-decade opening for a trusted, user-first alternative.

### 4. The Elegant Solution

Beet is a vertical super-aggregator. By consolidating the fragmented supply of events, media, and commerce and presenting it through a single, curated, mobile-first interface, we eliminate the time tax and solve the discovery problem. We are a utility for cultural connection.

## **Part 3: The Machine (The "What")**

### 1. Core Principles (The Laws of Our Company)

#### **Product Physics:**

* **Curation Over Clutter:** We are editors, not just a search engine.
* **Speed is a Feature:** The product must feel instantaneous.
* **Trust is the Default:** We are transparent with pricing and data.

#### **Engineering Ethos:**

* **Build for 10x:** Architect for the next order of magnitude.
* **Automate Everything:** Manual processes are bugs.
* **Ship Daily:** We move with urgency and iterate based on data.

### 2. The Equation of Success (First-Principle Metrics)

Our business is governed by this formula. We will set and track goals for each variable quarterly.

```
Growth = (Content Aggregated) x (Acquisition Rate) x (Engagement & Retention Rate)
```

* **Q3 2025 Content Goal:** 200 active events in SF Bay Area
* **Q3 2025 Acquisition Goal:** 2,000 total users
* **Q3 2025 Engagement Goal:** 20% WAU/MAU ratio

* **Q4 2025 Content Goal:** 800 active events across 3 cities
* **Q4 2025 Acquisition Goal:** 8,000 total users
* **Q4 2025 Engagement Goal:** 25% WAU/MAU ratio

### 3. The Anti-Patterns (What We Will Not Do)

* We will not build generic social media features.
* We will not be distracted by B2B revenue before consumer dominance.
* We will not compromise user experience with *intrusive* advertising.

## **Part 4: Known Unknowns (The "What If")**

### 1. Core Assumptions & Validation Plan

#### **Assumption #1 (The "Super-App" Thesis):**
  Users desire one app for events, movies, *and* deals.
##### **Validation Plan:**
  Track cross-feature usage.
  Success Criteria: >25% of WAU engage with 2+ categories by December 2025.

#### **Assumption #2 (The "Scalable Content" Thesis):**
  We can automate content aggregation at a low cost.
##### **Validation Plan:**
  Build and test initial scrapers/integrations.
  Success Criteria: Aggregate 80% of target events with <5 hours/week manual effort by March 2026.

### 2. Existential Risks & Mitigation

#### **Risk #1 (The "Chicken-and-Egg" Problem):**
  No users without events; no events without users.
##### **Mitigation:**
  We will be the "supply side" at launch. We will manually onboard the first 100 high-quality events in our launch market for free.

#### **Risk #2 (Partnership Failure):**
  We fail to secure API access from major ticketing platforms.
##### **Mitigation:**
  Our initial model will rely on web-scraping and affiliate links, which do not require permission, providing a runway to prove our value and strengthen our future negotiating position.
