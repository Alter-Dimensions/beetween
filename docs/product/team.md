# Team

*This document outlines how we operate. It is not a set of rules, but a framework for high-velocity, high-quality execution. We expect everyone to understand and embody these principles.*

## **1. The Mission**

Our mission is to build the indispensable utility for the Indian diaspora's social and cultural life by
**`B`ringing `E`verything `E`verywhere `T`ogether**. Anything that does not directly and meaningfully contribute to this mission is a distraction.

## **2. The Team: A Small Density of Talent**

We are not a family; we are a professional sports team. We hire and retain the best player for each position to win a championship. Titles are secondary to capability and ownership.

**Core Responsibilities (The "Heads Of"):**

* **The Mission & The "What" (Product):** Ranga Reddy
> *Owns the product vision, the roadmap, and is the final arbiter of what we build.*
* **The Machine & The "How" (Engineering):** Anirudh Jwala
> *Owns the technical architecture, code quality, and the speed/reliability of our systems. Responsible for building a world-class engineering engine.*
* **The User Experience (Design Advisory):** Roxtim
> *Owns the end-to-end user journey, from initial concept to final pixel. Ensures the product is simple, elegant, and effective.*

### Engineering & Execution:

* Rupam
* Ansh

> Responsible for shipping high-quality, tested code at a rapid pace. Expected to understand the product and contribute to the "what," not just execute the "how." Quality is everyone's responsibility.*

**Project Velocity & Operations:** Anirudh Jwala

> Responsible for removing blockers, facilitating communication, and ensuring the team maintains a high operational tempo.

## **3. The Principles of Operation**

These are not suggestions. They are the physics of how we work.

* **First Principles Thinking:** Do not accept things as they are. Break down every problem to its fundamental truths and reason up from there. The best idea wins, regardless of who it comes from.
* **Act with Extreme Urgency:** We operate with a sense of urgency that is orders of magnitude higher than our competitors. Every day matters. Speed is a feature.
* **The CEO is the "Head of Product":** All key product and design decisions flow through Ranga to ensure a singular, cohesive vision. There is no ambiguity.
* **No Silos. Full-Stack Problem Solving:** You are expected to communicate directly with whomever you need to solve a problem, without intermediaries. At any point you can ask for clarity Product Manager or Product Owner. There are no departments, only a shared mission.
* **Own Your Work End-to-End:** When you are given a task, you own its success from conception to deployment and beyond. There is no "that's not my job."

## **4. The Communication Protocol**

Communication should be efficient and clear.

* **Primary Channel:** Use direct messages or but we can transperency use dedicated Discord channels. Communication should be concise and to the point.
* **Meetings are a Bug, Not a Feature:**
  * Only schedule a meeting if it's the only way to solve a problem.
  * Keep them as short as possible.
  * Have a clear agenda and a decision-maker present.
  * If you are not adding value to a meeting, leave. It is not rude to leave; it is rude to waste your time and the company's resources.
* **Asynchronous is Default:** Use written communication (Discord, documents) by default to maintain momentum. Only use synchronous meetings to unblock complex issues.

## **5. The Definition of Done**

A task is "done" when it is:
1. **Shipped:** Deployed to production.
2. **Working:** Verified to meet the user's needs and quality standards.
3. **Monitored:** We understand its performance and impact.

---

## **6. Performance Expectations**

Your performance is not measured by hours worked but by the **impact and quality of your output.** We expect everyone to be a significant contributor to the mission. We will be candid and direct with feedback. We expect you to be as well.

This is not the right place for everyone, and that is by design. We are building a small, elite team to solve a difficult problem with excellence.
