## The Foundation: Start Here

**🎯 What is Beet?**

Beet is the all-in-one entertainment hub for the Indian diaspora in the U.S.

We bring together:

* 🎟️ Local Events — concerts, cultural fests, college shows, and more
* 🍿 Movies — ticketing across all major chains for Indian films
* 🍛 Food Deals — curated offers from Indian restaurants near you
* 📰 Entertainment News — the latest from Bollywood, Tollywood, and beyond

Beet = Bringing Everything Everywhere Together

No more jumping between apps. Beet simplifies your social life with one powerful platform — whether you're planning a night out, catching a new release, or staying up to date with Desi pop culture.

**🤝 What is Beetween?**

This is not a task tracker. Beetween is our collective memory. It's where we document our product's vision, key decisions, and core principles to ensure all teams are building with a shared understanding. This documentation serves as our mutual agreement on the product's direction, features, and user experience.
