# Getting Started at Beet

**Building the solution to a problem 5 million (1M potential) Indian Americans face every weekend.**

---

## The Problem

**Picture this:** It's Thursday night. You want to find something fun to do this weekend. As an Indian American, you want events that actually speak to your culture.

**What happens today?**
- Check Facebook for desi events (find 2)
- Browse Eventbrite (mostly generic stuff)
- Check WhatsApp groups (outdated info)
- Visit theater websites for Bollywood movies (sold out)
- Ask friends on Instagram (get 5 different answers)
- Spend 30 minutes, find nothing good, give up

**This is broken.** Our community deserves better.

---

## Our Solution: BEET

**BEET = Bringing Everything Everywhere Together**

One app that knows what the Indian diaspora actually wants:

- **Events** — Cricket matches, Bollywood concerts, Garba nights, comedy shows
- **Movies** — Every Bollywood, Tollywood, and regional film, all theaters
- **Dining** — The best Indian restaurants with exclusive community deals
- **Culture** — News, gossip, and trends from back home

**The goal:** Replace 10 scattered apps with one that actually gets our community.

## What is Beetween?

**Beetween** = The space **between** scattered platforms

This documentation site is our team's bridge. It's where we document:
- **Why** we're building what we're building
- **How** we make decisions as a team
- **What** we've learned from users and mistakes

Think of it as our collective brain - making sure everyone builds toward the same vision of solving this real problem for our community.

## Ship-Fast Philosophy

**We build like Elon builds rockets:**
- **Ship from day one** - Even if it's imperfect
- **Iterate obsessively** - Every week makes it better
- **User feedback drives everything** - We talk to users weekly
- **Speed beats perfect** - First to market wins in our niche

**Current mission:** Beta launch August 1st with 100 SF Bay Area users who actually love using it.
