# Building Beet for the Agent-Driven Future

## What Makes a Platform Agent-Ready?

Following Karpathy's vision, agent-ready platforms enable AI systems to:
- **Navigate and understand** all features programmatically
- **Execute actions** on behalf of users
- **Learn and adapt** from interactions
- **Collaborate** with other agents

## Beet's Agent Architecture

### Universal API Layer

Every Beet feature exposes semantic APIs:

```
GET /api/v1/movies/search
Parameters:
- query: "Telugu movies this weekend"
- location: auto-detected or specified
- preferences: user profile or explicit

Response:
- Structured movie data
- Availability status
- Related recommendations
- Action endpoints
```

### Semantic Understanding

APIs understand intent, not just keywords:
- "Find something fun for date night" → Movies + Restaurants
- "Plan my mom's birthday" → Events + Restaurants + Gift ideas
- "I'm bored this weekend" → Personalized entertainment options

### Agent Authorization Framework

**Graduated Permissions**:
1. **Read-Only**: Browse and recommend
2. **Assisted Booking**: Require confirmation
3. **Autonomous Actions**: Pre-authorized spending limits
4. **Full Agency**: Complete entertainment planning

**Smart Limits**:
- Spending caps by category
- Time-based restrictions
- Location boundaries
- Social permissions

## Agent Capabilities by Feature

### Entertainment Planning Agent

**What it can do**:
- Monitor movie releases matching preferences
- Track ticket availability and pricing
- Coordinate group bookings
- Optimize for rewards and discounts

**Example Flow**:
1. Agent detects new Telugu movie release
2. Checks user's typical movie-going patterns
3. Finds optimal showtime based on calendar
4. Identifies nearby Indian restaurants
5. Proposes complete evening plan
6. Books upon approval (or automatically if authorized)

### Social Coordination Agent

**Capabilities**:
- Analyze friend group availability
- Suggest group-friendly activities
- Handle complex scheduling
- Manage group payments

**Smart Features**:
- "Find time when 80% of group is free"
- "Book only if at least 4 friends confirm"
- "Split costs based on past patterns"

### Rewards Optimization Agent

**Functions**:
- Track all earning opportunities
- Maximize point accumulation
- Smart redemption timing
- Cross-partner optimization

**Intelligence**:
- "Use Beet Pay at this restaurant for 3x points"
- "Save points for Diwali - better redemption value"
- "Complete 2 more activities for bonus rewards"

### Cultural Calendar Agent

**Responsibilities**:
- Track cultural and religious events
- Proactive booking suggestions
- Community event coordination
- Festival preparation assistance

**Contextual Understanding**:
- Knows Navratri dates and suggests Garba events
- Books restaurants for Iftar during Ramadan
- Coordinates Diwali celebration venues

## Agent Interoperability

### Cross-Platform Integration

Beet agents can work with:
- **Calendar Apps**: Sync entertainment plans
- **Payment Platforms**: Coordinate transactions
- **Social Networks**: Event invitations
- **Transportation**: Uber/Lyft for events
- **Communication**: WhatsApp for group coordination

### Agent-to-Agent Protocol

Beet agents can negotiate with:
- **Restaurant Agents**: Table availability and pricing
- **Theater Agents**: Group booking discounts
- **Event Agents**: Exclusive access or deals
- **Payment Agents**: Optimal payment routing

## Privacy and Control

### User Sovereignty

- **Transparent Actions**: See what agents are doing
- **Granular Controls**: Specific permissions by feature
- **Activity Logs**: Complete audit trail
- **Instant Revocation**: One-click to disable

### Privacy-Preserving AI

- **Local Preference Processing**: Sensitive data stays on device
- **Federated Learning**: Improve without sharing personal data
- **Differential Privacy**: Aggregate insights without individual exposure
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verify eligibility without revealing details

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- RESTful APIs for all features
- Basic authentication and authorization
- Simple rule-based automation

### Phase 2: Intelligence (6 months)
- Natural language API interfaces
- Learning user preferences
- Basic autonomous actions
- Agent SDK release

### Phase 3: Ecosystem (12 months)
- Full agent marketplace
