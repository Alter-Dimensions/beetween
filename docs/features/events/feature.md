# Beet Events

## 1. Why It Exists

**Problem it solves**: The Indian diaspora in the USA struggles to discover cultural events, festivals, concerts, and community gatherings. Information is scattered across WhatsApp groups, Facebook pages, and word-of-mouth, causing people to miss events they would have loved to attend.

**Value proposition**: Comprehensive event discovery platform specifically for Indian cultural events across the USA. From Bollywood concerts to Diwali celebrations, classical music to standup comedy - all in one place with easy booking and group coordination features.

**Strategic importance**: Events are social experiences that drive group bookings and higher transaction values. This feature positions Beet as the cultural hub for the Indian community, driving both revenue and community engagement.
