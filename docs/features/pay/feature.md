# Beet Pay

## 1. Why It Exists

**Problem it solves**: Users are spending too much on entertainment without earning rewards. Traditional payment methods don't provide incentives for frequent entertainment purchases, leading to buyer's remorse and reduced spending. Group payments for entertainment are complicated and reward distribution is messy.

**Value proposition**: Revolutionary payment platform that rewards every transaction with Beet Bucks, enables seamless group splitting, and offers dynamic rewards based on activity chains. Double rewards for same-day entertainment activities (movie + dinner), creating an ecosystem where spending more actually saves more.

**Strategic importance**: Core revenue generation and user retention feature. Beet Pay creates platform stickiness by making Beet the preferred payment method for all entertainment purchases. Drives partner adoption and enables sophisticated reward mechanics that competitors can't match.
