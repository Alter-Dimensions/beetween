# Beet Notifications

## 1. Why It Exists

**Problem it solves**: Users miss out on time-sensitive opportunities, events sell out without their knowledge, and they don't discover relevant experiences that match their interests. Traditional apps bombard users with irrelevant notifications, leading to notification fatigue and disabled alerts.

**Value proposition**: Smart, contextual notifications that feel like a helpful friend reminding you about things you actually care about. Every notification drives engagement, creates value, and enhances the entertainment experience.

**Strategic importance**: Notifications are the connective tissue between all Beet features - they drive user engagement, increase transaction frequency, enable partnership value delivery, and create the "wow" moments that differentiate Beet from generic entertainment apps.
