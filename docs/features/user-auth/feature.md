# Authentication

## 1. Why It Exists

**Security Foundation**: Every other feature in Beet requires knowing who the user is. Without authentication, we can't protect user data or provide personalized experiences.

**User Trust**: Professional authentication builds confidence that Beet is a legitimate, secure platform users can trust with their data.

**Personalization**: Once users are authenticated, we can save their preferences, show their specific data, and customize their experience.

**Legal Requirements**: Many privacy and data protection laws require secure user authentication to protect personal information.

## 2. Scope

### MVP (Current Phase)
- New user registration with email and password
- Email verification to confirm accounts are real
- Secure login and logout
- Password reset for forgotten passwords
- Session management to keep users logged in

### Future Phases
- **Phase 2**: Social Login (Google, Facebook, Apple sign-in), Two-Factor Authentication
- **Phase 3**: Single Sign-On (Enterprise SSO), Advanced Roles and Permissions

## 3. Design Considerations

### Security Approach
- Email/password only for MVP (no social login initially)
- Password requirements balance security and usability
- 24-hour session duration
- Email verification required before first login

### User Experience
- Registration completion target: 2 minutes
- Login success rate target: 95%+ on first attempt
- Email verification within 5 minutes
- Password reset completion without support contact

### Technical Architecture
- Database design with secure password hashing
- JWT-based session management
- Reliable email service integration
- Performance targets: registration <10s, login <5s

## 4. Validation

### Success Metrics
- **Registration completion rate**: 85%+ (industry average is 70%)
- **Email verification rate**: 75%+ within 24 hours
- **Login success rate**: 95%+ on first attempt
- **Password reset completion**: 70%+ complete the process
- **User retention**: 80%+ of registered users return within 7 days
- **Support tickets**: Less than 5% of users need authentication help

### Technical Validation
- Unit + integration tests for all flows
- Performance testing under load
- Security penetration testing
- Email delivery reliability testing

## 5. Risks & Edge Cases

### High Risk
- **Email delivery problems**: If verification emails don't arrive, users can't complete registration
  - *Mitigation*: Use reliable email service, provide "resend email" option
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Authentication is a common target for attacks
  - *Mitigation*: Follow security best practices, regular security reviews

### Medium Risk
- **User experience friction**: Complicated registration could reduce sign-ups
  - *Mitigation*: Keep process simple, test with real users
- **Performance under load**: Slow authentication frustrates users
  - *Mitigation*: Performance testing before launch

### Edge Cases
- **Password requirements too strict**: Might frustrate some users
  - *Mitigation*: Clear password guidelines, helpful error messages
- **Email verification delays**: Users may not receive emails immediately
  - *Mitigation*: Resend functionality, clear messaging about delays
