# User Profile

## 1. Why It Exists

**Problem it solves**: Users need a centralized place to manage their entertainment preferences, view their history, and control their Beet experience. Without profiles, the platform can't deliver personalized recommendations or track user achievements.

**Value proposition**: Complete entertainment profile that learns user preferences, tracks spending and rewards, showcases achievements, and enables social features for sharing experiences with friends.

**Strategic importance**: Profiles drive engagement through personalization and gamification. They're essential for recommendation algorithms, social features, and understanding user behavior patterns.

## 2. Scope

- Transaction and booking history
- Beet Bucks balance and history
- Privacy settings

### Future Phases
- **Phase 2**: Social features, friend connections, shared watchlists
- **Phase 3**: Achievements, badges, leaderboards, influencer profiles
