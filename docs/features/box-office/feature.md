# Beet Box Office

## 1. Why It Exists

**Problem it solves**: Movie-goers face fragmented booking experiences across different theater chains, miss group booking opportunities, and pay full price without rewards. Indian movie fans especially struggle to find shows, premieres, and special screenings. They also miss opportunities to extend their entertainment experience beyond just the movie.

**Value proposition**: One-stop movie booking platform for all major US theater chains with exclusive benefits: group discounts, Beet Bucks rewards, special access to premieres, fan shows, and meet-and-greets with Bollywood stars. Revolutionary "Entertainment Chain" experiences that connect movies to dining, shopping, and cultural activities for a complete evening out.

**Strategic importance**: Major revenue driver through booking fees and promotional partnerships with movie studios. Creates platform stickiness by becoming the go-to app for all movie bookings, especially for Indian cinema. Drives cross-feature engagement by connecting Box Office to Pay, Bucks, and partner restaurants.
