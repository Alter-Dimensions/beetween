# Features Documentation

## 🧠 Musk-Grade Structure

Following the principle **"The best part is no part"**, each feature is documented in a single `feature.md` file that contains everything needed to understand, build, and validate the feature.

## 📁 Structure

```
features/
├── README.md              # This file
├── _template.md           # Template for new features
├── user-auth/
│   └── feature.md         # Single source of truth
├── pay/
│   └── feature.md         # (when created)
├── profile/
│   └── feature.md         # (when created)
└── [other-features]/
    └── feature.md         # (when created)
```

## 📋 Feature Document Structure

Each `feature.md` follows this 6-section structure:

### 1. Why It Exists
- Problem it solves
- Value proposition  
- Strategic importance

### 2. Scope
- MVP functionality
- Future phases
- What's NOT included

### 3. Design Considerations
- User experience principles
- Technical architecture
- Business rules

### 4. Implementation Steps
- Phased approach with checkboxes
- Clear milestones and timelines
- Progress tracking

### 5. Validation
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Technical validation requirements
- How we know it's working

### 6. Risks & Edge Cases
- High/medium/low risk assessment
- Mitigation strategies
- Edge case handling

## 🚀 Creating a New Feature

1. **Copy the template**: `cp _template.md [feature-name]/feature.md`
2. **Fill in the sections**: Use the template as a guide
3. **Keep it updated**: Update progress and status regularly
4. **Stay focused**: Only add complexity when absolutely necessary

## 💡 Best Practices

### Do's ✅
- Keep everything in one file until complexity demands otherwise
- Use checkboxes for implementation tracking
- Include specific metrics and targets
- Document risks and mitigation strategies
- Update status and progress regularly

### Don'ts ❌
- Create multiple files for a single feature
- Use placeholder content ("Coming Soon")
- Over-document simple features
- Let documentation go stale

## 🔄 Maintenance

- **Weekly**: Update implementation progress
- **Monthly**: Review and update metrics
- **Quarterly**: Assess if complexity requires splitting

## 📊 Example Metrics

Good metrics are:
- **Specific**: "95% login success rate" not "high success rate"
- **Measurable**: Can be tracked automatically
- **Actionable**: Drive specific decisions
- **Time-bound**: Have clear targets and deadlines

**Remember**: Optimize for clarity and shipping speed, not documentation completeness.
