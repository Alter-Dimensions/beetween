# Beet Bites

## 1. Why It Exists

**Problem it solves**: Users miss out on entertainment opportunities because they're not actively searching. Traditional apps require intentional browsing, leading to low daily engagement and missed events that users would have loved.

**Value proposition**: Daily curated micro-content about entertainment, culture, and community events specifically for the Indian diaspora. Swipeable format makes discovery effortless and addictive, with exclusive early-bird deals creating urgency.

**Strategic importance**: Primary driver of Daily Active Users (DAU). Beet Bites creates a daily habit that naturally leads users to discover and purchase events, movies, and experiences through the platform.

## 2. Scope

### MVP (Current Phase)
- 10-15 daily curated bites
- Swipe interface (Tinder-style)
- Categories: Movies, Events, Food, Culture
- Early-bird ticket links
- Save for later functionality

### Future Phases
- **Phase 2**: Personalized feed, video bites, user-generated content
- **Phase 3**: AI curation, sponsored bites, bite sharing, comments

## 3. Design Considerations

### User Experience
- Load time: <1 second
- Bite consumption: 5-10 seconds each
- Daily session target: 3-5 minutes
- Visual-first design with minimal text
- Smooth swipe animations

### Technical Architecture
- Pre-cached content for offline viewing
- CDN for media delivery
- ML-based content ranking
- A/B testing framework for optimization

### Business Rules
- New bites published daily at 8 AM local time
- Bites expire after 48 hours
- Maximum 20 bites per day
- Early-bird deals valid for 24 hours
- Saved bites stored for 30 days

## 4. Validation

### Success Metrics
- **DAU increase**: 40% within 3 months
- **Session frequency**: 1.5+ opens per day
- **Bite engagement**: 80% swipe completion rate
- **Conversion**: 15% click-through to events/movies
- **Retention**: 60% weekly active users

### Technical Validation
- Content loading performance testing
- Swipe gesture responsiveness
- Personalization algorithm accuracy
- Push notification delivery rates

## 5. Risks & Edge Cases

### High Risk
- **Content quality**: Poor curation reduces engagement
  - *Mitigation*: Editorial team, user feedback, ML optimization
- **Information overload**: Too many bites overwhelm users
  - *Mitigation*: Daily limits, personalization, categories

### Medium Risk
- **Stale content**: Same content reduces return visits
  - *Mitigation*: Strict freshness requirements, diverse sources
- **Cultural misalignment**: Content doesn't resonate with diaspora
  - *Mitigation*: Community moderators, cultural consultants

### Edge Cases
- **No relevant content**: Slow news days
  - *Handling*: Evergreen content bank, user-generated fills
- **Regional differences**: Content relevance varies by location
  - *Handling*: Geo-targeted bites, local content partners
