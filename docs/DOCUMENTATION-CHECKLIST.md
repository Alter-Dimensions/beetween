## 🎯 Quick Wins (Do These First!)

### ⚡ 30-Minute Wins
1. **Update project description** in `docs/index.md`
2. **List team contacts** in `docs/overview/team.md`
3. **Document "how to run locally"** basics

### ⚡ 1-Hour Wins
4. **Create development setup guide** with step-by-step instructions
5. **Document current sprint goals** and key deadlines
6. **Write basic user authentication requirements**

### ⚡ 2-Hour Wins
7. **Create comprehensive onboarding checklist**
8. **Document git workflow and PR process**

## 🚨 Red Flags to Address Immediately

If you don't have these, prioritize them:
- [ ] **No one knows how to run the project locally**
- [ ] **Unclear who owns what parts of the codebase**
- [ ] **No documented process for code reviews**
- [ ] **Team members don't know the project vision**
- [ ] **No clear acceptance criteria for features**

## 📏 Success Metrics

**Week 1 Success:** New team member can set up and run project in < 30 minutes
**Week 2 Success:** Team knows exactly what they're working on for next month
**Week 3 Success:** Clear requirements exist for current development work
**Week 4 Success:** Decisions are documented as they're made

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with what hurts** - Document the things people ask about most
2. **Keep it current** - Better to have 5 accurate pages than 20 outdated ones
3. **Write for new team members** - They'll find gaps fastest
4. **Use real examples** - Concrete beats abstract every time
5. **Review monthly** - Schedule time to keep docs fresh

**Remember:** Good documentation is a competitive advantage that compounds over time! 🚀
