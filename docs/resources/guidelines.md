# Development Guidelines

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This document outlines the development guidelines and best practices for the Beet project. All team members should follow these guidelines to ensure consistent, maintainable, and high-quality code.

## Code Standards

### General Principles
- Write clean, readable, and self-documenting code
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Write comprehensive tests for all features

### Code Style
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for JavaScript/TypeScript, 4 spaces for Python)
- Use meaningful commit messages following conventional commits
- Follow language-specific style guides (ESLint for JavaScript, PEP 8 for Python)
- Use type annotations where applicable

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- Document all public APIs and interfaces
- Include examples in documentation
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes
- Use JSDoc for JavaScript/TypeScript, docstrings for Python

### Project Documentation
- Update README files when adding new features
- Document architectural decisions
- Maintain changelog for releases
- Include setup and deployment instructions

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Coverage
- Aim for at least 80% test coverage
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Include integration tests for critical paths
- Add end-to-end tests for user workflows

### Testing Best Practices
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both happy paths and error cases

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/user-authentication`, `bugfix/login-error`
- Use lowercase with hyphens
- Include ticket numbers when applicable: `feature/BEET-123-user-dashboard`

### Commit Guidelines
- Use conventional commit format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`
- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Make atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
- Reference issues and tickets in commit messages

### Pull Request Process
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Create pull request with clear description
5. Request code review from team members
6. Address review feedback
7. Merge after approval

## Security Guidelines

### Code Security
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Keep dependencies up to date

### Data Protection
- Follow GDPR and privacy regulations
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Use secure authentication methods
- Implement proper access controls

## Performance Guidelines

### Frontend Performance
- Optimize bundle sizes
- Use lazy loading for routes and components
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Optimize images and assets

### Backend Performance
- Use database indexes appropriately
- Implement caching where beneficial
- Monitor and optimize slow queries
- Use pagination for large datasets

## Deployment Guidelines

### Environment Management
- Use separate environments for development, staging, and production
- Maintain environment-specific configurations
- Use infrastructure as code where possible

### Release Process
- Follow semantic versioning
- Maintain release notes
- Test thoroughly in staging before production
- Have rollback procedures ready
