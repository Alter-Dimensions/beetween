## 🚧 Blockers & Dependencies

### Current Blockers
- **RESOLVED:** Database schema finalization (resolved by architecture meeting)
- **PENDING:** Design system color palette (waiting on design team feedback)

### Dependencies
- Dashboard work depends on user authentication completion
- Testing requires authentication endpoints to be functional
- Monitoring setup needs production environment access

## 📊 Previous Sprint Review

### Completed
- ✅ Project setup and initial documentation structure
- ✅ Database schema design and implementation
- ✅ Basic project architecture decisions
- ✅ Development environment setup for all team members

### Incomplete/Carried Over
- ❌ User registration (moved to this sprint)
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline (partially complete, finishing this sprint)

### Lessons Learned
- Need better estimation for infrastructure tasks
- Daily standups should include blocker discussions
- Pair programming helped with complex architecture decisions

## 🎯 Definition of Done

For each ticket to be considered complete:
- [ ] Feature implemented and tested locally
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Code reviewed by at least one team member
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
- [ ] Product owner acceptance

## 💭 Notes & Decisions

### Technical Decisions
- **JWT vs Sessions:** Decided on JWT for stateless authentication
- **Database:** Using PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Testing:** Jest for unit tests, Cypress for integration tests

### Process Decisions
- **Code Review:** Minimum 1 reviewer, preferably 2 for complex features
- **Deployment:** Manual deployment to staging, automatic to docs
- **Communication:** Use Slack for urgent issues, async for everything else
